# AlchemistCodeCode

This project shows how basic network communication works with the game "The Alchemist Code", and how you can directly use some classes from the game code. This project also shows how to dump out game data from the Alchemist Code.

Things not included and you will have to include to get started:
1. Dump out AssemblySharp.dll from the game executable, and reference that dll. Many tutorials online.
2. Download DotNetWikiBot.cs to actually post to the wiki. I didn't include this because GPL.
